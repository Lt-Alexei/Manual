# Operating Vehicles

## _General Vehicle Information_ {#general-vehicle-information}

* Light vehicles, trucks and boats & most jeeps \(except light armored ones\) can be operated by any soldier. Armored vehicles, helicopters and aircraft need specified vehicle kits to operate. Players not using the correct kit will not be able to steer the vehicle or use the weapons. You can't enter or use enemy vehicles. For ground vehicles you then require a **Crewman** kit. For aircraft & helicopters it’s the **Pilot** kit. These are either requestable by the vehicle or by a supply crate.
* External views for vehicles have been removed. But for certain vehicles there are custom cameras like the trucks can watch behind them \(**C**\).
* You can **aim down the sights** of static and vehicle-mounted MGs by pressing the change camera key\(**C**\).
* Vehicle-mounted automatic weapons often have **overheating**. Watch the heat-HUD element on the lower right corner. ![](../assets/overheat.png)
* Vehicle-mounted MGs use ammunition belts. They are reloaded automatically but are limited in number.
* Vehicles can be **resupplied & repaired** at the supply depot. Or use the repair drop that any logistics truck can drop. Aircraft and Helicopters are automatically repaired and rearmed at their spawn location.
* Insurgents have **suicide vehicles** like an orange dumpster truck or small civilian cars packed with C4. You can detonate these with the alternative fire key.
* When exiting a moving ground vehicle you’ll take damage depending on its speed. You’ll be severely wounded if you exit a burning vehicle.
* When vehicles take much damage they may become unable to move or traverse their turret until fully repaired.
* Vehicles that **fire wire-guided missiles** need to be stationary for about 7 seconds before they can fire their weapon.
* Switching vehicle-weapons \(ammo type\) will usually cause a delay before you can fire.
* You can use **Left CTRL+Mouse movement** to freelook when operating most vehicles such as helicopters, jets, jeeps, boats and trucks. APCs and IFVs do not have this feature as they use dedicated cameras.
* On public servers (not in local gamemodes) you can quickly switch to the next available free seat in a vehicle by pressing **F8**.
* When in a vehicle, you can see the information on the occupied seats in the bottom left of the the HUD. It shows only important crew seats as squared markers. This includes driver and gunner positions. Passenger seats do not have such markers and are shown as a seperate counter.
## _Armored Vehicles_ {#armored-vehicles}

* Tanks and IFVs have separate driver & gunner seats. To use the gunner's position a driver or cupola gunner must be present. After switching to the gunner seat you must wait 30 seconds before you can aim the cannon.
* The driver and gunner in a vehicle must be in the same squad.
* Tank drivers and certain APC/IFVs have a **commander view mode** which provides a 360° view around the turret. This can be accessed by pressing 2.
* Drivers and gunners can **zoom** their view by pressing the pop smoke key \(**X**\). Some tank drivers must first change to the commander view.
* Most tanks and IFVs can use **thermal optics** in addition to their normal views. You can switch to the thermal mode by using secondary radio menu \(**T**\) and selecting **“DAY / THERMAL”.** Some will also allow you to switch between thermal variations like WHOT/BHOT.

> Thermal Vision

* Armored vehicles have no warning sound when they are targeted by rocket launchers or when missiles are fired at them.
* Armored vehicles have realistic materials. This means that front and turret armor is stronger than the one in the rear and top of the vehicle. Sides of vehicles and the tracks usually have the middle ground when it comes to armor strength.
* Tanks and IFVs usually have up to 4 types of ammunition:
  * **Armor-piercing \(AP\):** For attacking enemy armored vehicles.
  * **High Explosive \(HE\)** \(loaded by pressing 2\): Effective against soft targets \(jeeps, houses, helicopters, covered infantry, etc.\)
  * **Anti-tank missiles** \(loaded by pressing 3\): Used against heavy armor.
  * **Co-axial MG** \(fired using the alternate fire key\): Used against infantry.
* Tank drivers or gunners \(depending on vehicle\) and certain other vehicles can **deploy smoke** by pressing the alternate fire key.

Tank & IFV gunners deploy it by selecting its weapon slot \(usually 3\) and pressing the fire key to launch a volley of smoke bombs. Each of them can fire 2 volleys \(the gunner has to wait 60s between volleys\).

* For certain vehicles the smoke will be **IR-blocking** meaning it will also block on thermal vision. For other \(older vehicles\) you will be able to see through the smoke on thermal vision.

## _Helicopters_ {#helicopters}

* Helicopters have a **warm-up time** of around 30 seconds. If too much thrust is generated while the rotor blades spin up, the pilot will lose control and crash. To start the helicopter you have to leave the throttle at idle for at least 30 seconds before trying to lift off.
* Helicopter pilots can look in other directions while flying by pressing the 6, 7, 8 and 9 keys which you can map to a joystick POV HAT Switch. To look forwards again press 1 or select any other weapon your aircraft has.
* The rudder controls are mostly effective at low speeds. At higher speeds you need to bank the helicopter to turn.
* Players using **the pilot kit cannot occupy any of the passenger seats** of an aircraft. This is to stop players using the pilot kit as some kind of SF paratrooper assault kit because it has a parachute. If you have had to bail out of your aircraft and then receive a pickup from another aircraft, ensure you drop your pilot kit before entering the aircraft’s passenger seat otherwise you will be forced out of the helicopter.
* The pilot of Heavy Attack Helicopters aka Gunships can fire the **unguided rockets** while the gunner controls the cannon and guided missiles.
* Gunners in attack helicopters can zoom their weapons camera by pressing the cycle camera key \(**C**\) or by pressing the F9 to F11 keys. They can also switch to a thermal imaging mode by using the secondary radio menu \(**T**\) and selecting **“DAY / THERMAL”** to toggle between the two.
* The attack-helicopter's **gunner** has 4 different modes to choose from:
* First-person view in the cockpit
* Gun-camera which controls the helicopter's gun
* **Laser-guided fire mode \(LG\)** allows a semi-manual targeting mode, where you can click on the target and the missile will guide itself towards it and click again to update the targets location to the missile in flight.
* **Laser-targeted fire mode** **\(LT\)** \(fire-and-forget\) locks the missile onto a laser target provided by ground troops or a scout helicopter. The laser targeted mode is the best choice if a spotter can designate the target. It allows minimal exposure of the helicopter. The laser guided mode allows the best tracking of moving targets. However if the target hasn’t been “lazed” correctly or badly, or simply for some reason the missile can’t see the target after launch like if a building gets in the way, the missile may miss.
* Helicopter crews need to be in the same squad.
* Helicopters must return to the helipad and land to be **rearmed/repaired**. On Carriers you can only reload on the “ramp” of the carrier, off the runway, this doesn't include the lifts.
* To successfully **drop supplies** from a transport helicopters the pilot needs to conduct the drop from an altitude under 5m / 15 feet by pressing the alternate fire key.
* **Countermeasure flares** are limited and need to be rearmed when expended. Every time you deploy flare\(**X**\) one flare will be deployed.

## _Fixed Wing Aircraft_ {#fixed-wing-aircraft}

* Aircraft have a **warm-up time** of 30 seconds before they can take off from the ground.
* Jet pilots can look in other directions while flying by pressing the 7, 8 and 9 keys which you can map to a joystick POV HAT Switch. To look forwards again press 1 or select any other weapon your aircraft has.
* To slowly **taxi** on the ground keep the throttle neutral and push the stick forward or press the up arrow key, to slowly move in that direction. Pull the stick back or press the down arrow key to reverse. To steer left and right use the rudder controls \(**A & D**\).
* Your maximum altitude is 10km.
* To **take off** you need to put the throttle on maximum and then wait a little for the plane to start accelerating. When you are down 2/3 of the runway gently start pulling on the stick and maybe add some afterburner.
* Most aircraft come equipped with a **cannon and several external weapons**. The primary fire key will fire the cannon \(if your aircraft has one\) while the alternate fire key will fire the currently selected weapon such as bombs and missiles.
* To **re-arm and repair** you do need to land the aircraft at your airbase and taxi to the “ramp” or on some very few maps, on the runway. It takes quite some time to rearm completely. On Carriers you can only reload on the “ramp” of the carrier, off the runway. This doesn't include the lifts.
* Most fixed wing aircraft feature **ejection seats** when you press E. It will automatically deploy the parachute when below 750m. 
* **Air-to-ground weapons** in single seat aircraft need an established laser lock to hit a target. The recommended procedure for an attack with them is explained below:
  1. Ground troops find a suitable target for an air attack.
  2. The troops contact the pilot either directly through mumble/text chat and/or by placing a CAS marker. ![](../assets/marker.png)
  3. The pilot informs the ground troops of his approach using the **“ON THE WAY”** command from his main radio menu and/or through mumble/text chat.
  4. As the pilot approaches the target, the ground troops mark the target with a **GTLD laser** designator, if the laser is slightly off from the target, the missile may miss.
  5. When the target is locked-on the pilot receives a sound cue. He may now release the bomb/missile.
* **Two-seater aircraft** allow the weapons systems officer \(WSO\) to identify and engage targets by himself while using the TV targeting mode. The targeting modes work in the same way as in attack helicopters.
* The commander can place a laser target from his map. Since this method is not very precise it should only be used to bomb static targets.
* Aircrafts don't have a nose camera but you can still look back by pressing the cycle camera key \(**C**\) or F11 to look back, and F9 or a weapon key to look forwards again.
* **Flares** are triggered individually\(**X**\) and need to be rearmed after all of them have been dropped. Since the warning sound is only played once the enemy has already locked onto your aircraft for half a second, it is recommended to use them while on an attack run to reduce the chance of the enemy establishing a lock.
* **To land** in PR:BF2 you need to plan ahead much longer than in BF2. Here are some tips on how to make your first landings easier:
* You need to reduce your speed in advance until you can just stay level without falling out of the sky \(about 40% power\) with the stall airspeed being different for each aircraft. \(You can find the stall speed of your aircraft yourself by just going up high and slowing your aircraft down until it starts to lose control and fall, but doing it up high will mean you can regain control by opening up the throttle and pointing your nose down, then just stay above that stall speed while landing, until your wheels hit the ground.\)
* When you are at this speed you should start your approach.
* Imagine a point on the map by extending the runway by about 1km.
* Fly to this point and turn towards the runway.
* When you are about 200m from the runway cut your throttle.
* Once you have touched the ground pull back on the stick to slow down, the planes all handle individually.
